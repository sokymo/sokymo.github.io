									<h3>SMART HOME INFOGRAPHIC</h3>

									<p class="pspacingbottom">The purpose of this Smart Home Infographic I designed was to inform the Insurance industry, as well as the Smart Home industry, of the benefits of home telematics for the Home Insurance industry. Originally, I was given an idea of the content for the infographic but no specific direction. My process began with researching other infographics of different industries (particularly the automobile industry) and statistics regarding home insurance. I designed an infographic with information I found online and in the Plasmatic whitepaper to communicate the importance of home telematics data. I revised the infographic after every session of feedback I received from the VP of Marketing.</p>

									<p><span class="bold">The infographic was a large project with a very iterative process, as the company had specific information and visuals they wished to convey to the Home Insurance industry.</span></p>

									<h3>PLASMATIC BANNER</h3>

									<p>This Plasmatic Banner was the first in two standing banners I created to be displayed at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas. I received the text content of the banner as well as a general hierarchy of each section, and designed the banner using corporate colors so the Plasmatic booth would have a strong brand identity.</p>

									<p><span class="bold">The various curves in the banner have several purposes: to communicate the dynamic aspect of the company, to lead the viewer's eye down the banner, and to connect every section, as curved shapes tend to be more commonly associated with connection.</span></p>

									<h3>ALANA BANNER</h3>

									<p>The Product Banner, which was the keypad Alana, was created in the same manner as the Plasmatic one, and also for the Consumer Electronics Show.
									</p>

									<p><span class="bold">This banner was created with a similar style to the Plasmatic Banner to maintain consistency. The blues are a combination of the Plasmatic brand colors and the Alana product colors.</span></p>

									<h3>BUSINESS CARD</h3>

									<p class="pspacingbottom">My process in creating the business card was by beginning with many sketches of various concepts. I was inspired by the company's logo and wanted to bring that into the design. My company wanted a business card that was simple on the front and creative on the back. Hence, I recreated the shapes from the logo on the back of the card while mirroring the semicircle shape on the front.</p>

									<h3>HOLIDAY CARDS</h3>

									<p>As the holiday season was approaching during my term at Plasmatic, I was tasked to create two holiday cards for the company - one for the company party and one as a general holiday greeting. The cards were requested to stay neutral (not specific to one particular holiday). I created a neutral winter scene for the first card, and got more creative with the second card by making "smart home" ornaments to go along with Plasmatic's focus in smart homes.</p>
