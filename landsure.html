									<h3>RESEARCH METHODS</h3>

									<p>I used a variety of research methods to consult with customers (users) and understand the domain, their jobs, needs, pain points, tasks, and ultimately how their lives can be improved when using LandSure's current and future systems.</p>

									<p>
										<span class="bold">Customer and Internal Staff Workshops:</span> I planned and co-facilitated two customer workshops with my manager. The goals of our workshops were to understand customers overall, as well as gain information the company needed in order to move forward with the new company project. I was responsible for creating some of the workshop activities, drawing large paper templates for customers to fill out during the activities, guiding customers and facilitating discussions during workshops, note taking, and compiling all the data gained from the workshops.
									</p>

									<p>My manager and I also hosted three internal staff workshops - one with Technical Support, one with Practice and Policy (legal) Support, and a sketch design workshop with members of different departments. I helped plan activities, pinpoint information we needed to discover, and documented the results of all the workshops.</p>

									<p>
										<span class="bold">Customer Site Visits and Job Shadowing:</span> My manager and I conducted customer site visits to gain information about customers on an individual level, as well as job shadow them to understand different firms' processes and tasks. I had a larger role in these customer site visits, as I was responsible for arranging site visits and dates with customers, creating a plan that detailed our goals and activities for the site visits, and coming up with a detailed list of questions to interview customers during the site visits. I was the main interviewer during the site visits, and actively contributed to discussions.
									</p>

									<p>
										<span class="bold">Internal Staff Call Shadowing:</span> Shadowing Technical Support and Practice and Policy Support phone calls was another way to research issues users were having with our systems. I sat next to a Technical Support or Practice and Policy Support representative and listened on their phone line while they helped customers. This allowed me to hear the user recount their experience with our systems, the problems they ran into, and their emotions.
									</p>

									<p>
										<span class="bold">Customer Surveys:</span> I created a printed customer survey that was distributed to customers during workshops and collected at the end. The survey's goal was to see if there were connections or patterns between points of data such as firm size, years of experience, and responsibilities. I compiled the results of the survey into an Excel spreadsheet, and later created a more detailed survey online using SurveyMonkey that would be sent to consulted customers.

									<h3>USER PERSONAS</h3>

									<p>I created personas of our three primary user groups: lawyers, notaries, and paralegals. These personas were created at the beginning of my work term using information from the persona activity of the first customer workshop. I updated them after every internal/customer workshop, customer site visit, and call shadowing activity throughout the months. The personas were also shown to several customers in order to validate their accuracy.</p>

									<p>Sections of the personas shown below have been censored due to confidential information.</p>

									<p class="pspacing">The Lawyer persona and a comparison summary between the personas are shown above. The personas served to construct a "typical customer" of each role, containing crucial information ranging from their daily activites and tasks to problems they run into regularly. The personas also had information about them as a user: their activites and expectations when using our online portals.</p>

									<h3>JOURNEY MAPS</h3>

									<p>A major goal of the customer experience team I was in was to understand every part of the customer's experience through a particular task - conveyancing - thoroughly. This would help us design our future systems to make each step of their journey as painless as possible. I created three user journey maps, focused on lawyers, notaries, and paralegals, at the beginning of my work term - around the same time as the personas. These journey maps were also continuously updated as I obtained more information with my research methods.</p>

									<p>Sections of the journey map shown below have been censored due to confidential information.</p>

									<p class="pspacing">We were able to capture a large amount of information in our research, and I extracted data such as lawyers' tasks, pain points (problems), emotions, mobile usage, touchpoints (people or areas they interacted with), and opportunities (suggested improvements) to be put into the journey map shown above.</p>

									<h3>CONVEYANCE STORYMAP</h3>

									<p>One of the most important mini-projects I worked on was a storymap of features required for users to successfully complete a conveyance using our future online platform. This storymap served as the base document for my team, as well as others working on the future platform, to refer to in order to start wireframing and prototyping. It contains the stages of the main journey we are interested in for the user, their goals at each stage, the activities they do to complete each goal, and the features the system must have for them to complete those activities. I was responsible for the ideation, creation, design, and revision of this storymap.</p>

									<p>All sections in the storymap have been censored due to confidential information, so they appear as empty boxes. The original version of the storymap contains text in each box describing features the online platform will have (determined by the business) or suggestions for features that will improve the design and user experience of the platform. </p>

								</div>

								<a href="images/p6/landsure5.jpeg" target=_blank><img class="projectimages" src="images/p6/landsure4_5.jpg" alt="A Storymap of the conveyancing process from the perspective of the firm representing the buyer"></a>


								<div class="pcontent">
									<h3>PROCESS</h3>

									<p>I began the process of creating the storymap by referring to a Business Design document (a 150+ page documentation of the business needs and requirements of the new online platform, written by various stakeholders within the company for over a year) that contained all of the business needs of the platform. After extracting and matching information from the document to the goals and activities of the user, I went through each activity and brainstormed of what features/functionalities (that were not covered by the Business Design document) the user would need to complete it. I also envisioned what each web page the user is in might look like, along with details such as the types of interactions on the page, how the pages linked together, and the placement of elements to allow efficient completion of the activity. I cross-referenced my ideas with the Business Design document to ensure they did not contradict business requirements, and fleshed out the storymap over the course of 3 days.</p>

									<p>After the initial storymap was done, I held a meeting between my team and several members of different departments to review the storymap. The meeting allowed for a general review of the storymap, and I made edits based on feedback. A signficantly more detailed review was given by an experienced member of the business team who had helped write the Business Design document. I made several iterations of the storymap with every piece of new feedback that I received, and filled in any gaps.</p>

									<p>The storymap proved to be a highly useful artifact, as it helped connect our user research and the user's journey to actual features that could appear in wireframes. Before the storymap, our only starting point for designing a brand new online platform was the 150+ page Business Design document. The storymap I created not only extracts the most crucial points of information from that large document, but also contains more details and ideas of the system design - all from a user-centric point of view, based on user research my team had done. When my team began to wireframe, we were able to refer to each column in the storymap to see what the user wanted to do, what they required to do it, and how features/interactions might look on the page.</p>

									<h3>PROCESS MAP</h3>

									<p>During my work term at LandSure, I also created a lean process map. The purpose of this diagram was to view the flow of each step of the conveyancing journey (from the perspective of the firm representing the buyer of a property). The map shows each step of the process (taken from the various user research I conducted), the relationship between different roles, and identifies areas of improvement. I used most of the information gained from my site vists and job shadowing of customers to make this detailed flowchart.</p>

									<p>A section of the process map is shown below (click to view the full map). The boxes appear blank as they have been censored due to confidential information.</p>
