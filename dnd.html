									<h3>FINAL PROTOTYPE</h3>

									<p class="pspacingbottom">The final prototype follows the path of a newcomer learning D&#38;D through the D&#38;D Beyond mobile application. <span class="bold">I was responsible for creating the screens beyond the assessment questions.</span> Upon opening the app and tapping on the 'Take Assessment' button located in the top banner, the user is led to a D&#38;D knowledge assessment so that the app can determine which types of information about D&#38;D may be relevant to their learning interests.</p>
								</div>

									<img class="projectimagestriple" src="images/pdnd/dnd5.png" alt="Dungeons&#38;Dragons Prototype Screens">

									<div class="pcontent">
									<p class="pspacingbottom">The app displays a lessons dashboard after the user finishes the assessment, where <span class="bold">lessons relevant to their interests are highlighted</span>. When tapping on a lesson, the user is given a quick breakdown about specific rules and mechanics of D&#38;D that will be taught in that lesson, as well as two paths to learning the lesson. 66% of 310 respondents of a survey created for this project are attracted to D&#38;D due to roleplaying and storytelling, so <span class="bold">one of the offered lesson paths ("Interactive Tutorial") uses narrative and immersive elements in order to create a more engaging and fun learning experience</span>.</p>

									<p class="pspacingbottom">As D&#38;D is centered around storytelling and making choices, <span class="bold">the user will be able to make choices that affect the narrative of the game, to give them a taste of the impact they can have within D&#38;D.</span> They can also review what they have learned at any point within the game.</p>

									<div class="pcontent">
									<p class="pspacingbottom">Another learning path is also available to the user from the lesson modal, which is for the user to read through the subjects taught within the lesson. <span class="bold">This path lets the user learn at their own pace, and in whichever order they want.</span> It also provides the user with information that can be quickly referred to again if they want to refresh their memory, or refer to information they've forgotten mid-game.</p>

									<h3>WHY LEARNING?</h3>

									<p>D&#38;D, despite being a popular and fun team-building game, poses a higher barrier to entry due to the depth of rules players must learn. 40% of incoming players from 310 respondents found existing official resources on D&#38;D websites and physical handbooks difficult to learn from due to complexity (pictured below), contributing to an <span class="bold">overwhelming 87% of respondents to look for information on D&#38;D from friends or game stores.</span></p>
									<p>Why does this matter? D&#38;D's publisher, Wizards of the Coast's business model relies on sales from updating existing editions of D&#38;D, publishing new materials, and events. <span class="bold">New consumers who do not, or rarely, engage with official D&#38;D websites will be less likely exposed to these D&#38;D offerings.</span></p>

									<h3>USER SURVEY</h3>

									<p class="pspacingbottom">A survey, which received 310 respondents, was created and posted on various platforms including D&#38;D Facebook groups, Reddit, D&#38;D Discord servers, and D&#38;D forums.</p>

									<h3>PERSONA</h3>

									<p class="pspacingbottom">I crafted a persona from compiling information and finding trends within the user survey responses. The persona helped us identify who we were designing for and what kinds of goals and pains they might have when learning and playing D&#38;D.</p>

									<h3>JOURNEY MAP</h3>

									<p class="pspacingbottom">Creating a customer journey map helped my team better understand how a newcomer to D&#38;D would encounter and learn about the game, as well as which stage of the journey would be most ideal to target with our solution. We identified that the area with most potential to be improved through design was the 'learning to play' stage, as newcomers expressed high resistance to the text-heavy and complicated official learning materials, preferring instead to have a friend teach them or watch player-made youtube videos. I recreated a more in-depth journey map below after revisiting this project.</p>

									<h3>ORIGINAL CONCEPT</h3>

									<p>This project's original concept was an <span class="bold">interactive storybook on the official D&#38;D website</span>, where the user could play through a standard tavern scenario that would occur in a real D&#38;D game. The concept also centered around <span class="bold">encouraging new players to be Dungeon Masters</span>, as secondary research, as well as several user interviews with experienced D&#38;D players, showed that although Dungeon Masters were a crucial role, it was perceived as intimidating due to how well Dungeon Masters had to know how to play the game. <span class="bold">We had made an assumption that new groups of friends who were interested in playing may have difficulties finding a Dungeon Master, and that there was a lack of onboarding for new players to become Dungeon Masters. I was responsible for information hierarchy, flow, and part of the UI.</span></p>

								<div class="pcontent">
									<h3>REFRAMING</h3>

									<p>However, once we conducted our more in-depth user survey of 310 participants, we discovered that there was a larger underlying issue of D&#38;D resources being complicated and difficult for any new potential player to learn from. Simply learning the basics of the game was intimidating - let alone becoming a Dungeon Master! We decided to reorient our user to any newcomer to D&#38;D, and change our focus to tackling the high barrier to entry resulting from a lack of effective onboarding for any new player, rather than just Dungeon Masters.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="pcontent">
									<h3>DESIGN SPRINT ACTIVITIES</h3>

									<p>Empathy mapping in our design sprints helped us dive deeper into our user's head to find out what emotions and thoughts they were having when learning and playing D&#38;D, as well as imagine how we could design to address these emotions and needs.</p>

									<a href="images/pdnd/empathyplayer.jpg" target=_blank><img class="projectimagesdouble" src="images/pdnd/empathyplayer.jpg" alt="Image from the final product"></a>
									<a href="images/pdnd/empathydm.jpg" target=_blank><img class="projectimagesdouble" src="images/pdnd/empathydm.jpg" alt="Image from the final product"></a>

									<p>Needs statements also helped us identify what kinds of needs and aspirations our user would have, so that we could design our solution with their aspirational goals in mind, rather than only addressing pains.</p>

								<div class="pcontent">
									<h3>MODIFIED CONCEPT</h3>

									<p>Our new reframe of the original business opportunity, target user, and design sprint activities led my team and I to realize that the interactive storybook was linear, and not flexible enough for a newcomer to D&#38;D to learn different aspects of the game at their own pace, as it involved the user needing to specially dedicate time to going through the storybook on a computer. However, the prototype had previously tested well, with the results shown below.</p>

									<a href="images/pdnd/storybook/storybooktest.png" target=_blank><img class="projectimages" src="images/pdnd/storybook/storybooktest.png" alt="D&#38;D Journey Map"></a>

									<p>Since the previous concept was successful in how it built-up and revealed information to the user, as well as all users finding it engaging and immersive, we decided to build upon the concept to fit our new user's needs and goals. Therefore, we retooled our design solution to a mobile application extension focused on lesson modules instead, where our narrative-based tavern scenario would live inside of a lesson module. <span class="bold">As 53% of survey respondents learned D&#38;D gameplay through an experienced friend, we chose to create a digital onboarding process that uses elements from learning through a friend, as well as an immersive learning experience that gives provides a "peek" into a D&#38;D game.</span></p>

									<h3>WIREFRAMES</h3>

									<p>I created the following wireframes for our modified solution with a focus on information hierarchy and flow, using Figma.</p>

									<h3>REFLECTION</h3>

									<p>My team's change in project direction to a mobile learning app extension allowed for more opportunities in enhancing the user's experience learning D&#38;D, and also providing learning flexibility. <span class="bold">I was a strong advocate in implementing the narrative-based, immersive scenarios into the lessons because they helped capture D&#38;D's spirit and contained the elements of D&#38;D that draw people's interest to the game.</span></p>

									<p>If I were to take this project further, I would begin <span class="bold">exploring ways to make this app more accessible during gameplay</span>, so that a D&#38;D player can refer to it quickly and easily if they forget a rule. I would also consider expanding the learning content of the app to more advanced information (as the app currently only provides enough information up to a user's first D&#38;D session), and <span class="bold">focus more on keeping the fun, immersive aspect throughout the entire application, rather than only within a lesson.</span></p>

									<p><span class="bold">Thanks for reading about my project! This project was created in a team of myself, Jessie Li, Emily Hui, Simranjit Bagga, Ali Reza Mogharrab, and Momchil Kutev. </span></p>
